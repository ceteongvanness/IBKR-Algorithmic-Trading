## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- QuantConnect account (free tier available)
- Basic understanding of algorithmic trading
- Risk capital you can afford to lose

### Installation Steps
1. **Create QuantConnect Account**
   ```
   Visit: https://www.quantconnect.com
   Sign up for free account
   ```

2. **Create New Algorithm Project**
   ```
   - Click "Create Algorithm"
   - Choose "Python" language
   - Name your project
   ```

3. **Copy Strategy Code**
   ```python
   # Replace default code with strategy code
   # Ensure proper imports at top:
   from AlgorithmImports import *
   ```

4. **Run Backtest**
   ```
   - Click "Backtest" button
   - Wait for results
   - Analyze performance metrics
   ```

## Risk Management Guidelines

### Position Sizing
- **Conservative:** 10-20% of portfolio per trade
- **Moderate:** 20-30% of portfolio per trade  
- **Aggressive:** 30%+ (NOT recommended)

### Stop Loss Guidelines
- **Low volatility stocks (KO):** 3-5%
- **Medium volatility stocks (MSFT):** 5-8%
- **High volatility stocks (NVDA):** 8-12%

### Capital Requirements by Strategy Type
- **Stable stocks (KO, MSFT):** $500-1,000 minimum
- **Growth stocks (GOOGL, AAPL):** $1,000-2,000 minimum
- **High volatility (NVDA, TSLA):** $2,000+ recommended

## Performance Metrics to Monitor

### Key Indicators
- **Sharpe Ratio:** >1.0 (excellent), >0.5 (acceptable)
- **Maximum Drawdown:** <15% (good), <20% (acceptable)
- **Win Rate:** >50% (good), >60% (excellent)
- **Total Return:** Should exceed benchmark

### Red Flags to Watch
- Consecutive losing streaks >5 trades
- Drawdown exceeding 25% of capital
- Emotional decision-making
- Overriding stop losses

## Development Workflow

### 1. Strategy Development
```python
# Start with simple strategy template
class NewStrategy(QCAlgorithm):
    def Initialize(self):
        # Basic setup
        pass
    
    def OnData(self, slice):
        # Trading logic
        pass
```

### 2. Backtesting Process
- Test on 3-5 years of historical data
- Analyze multiple market conditions
- Check performance across different periods
- Validate risk metrics

### 3. Paper Trading
- Deploy to paper trading first
- Monitor for 1-3 months minimum
- Track psychological impact
- Refine strategy based on results

### 4. Live Trading (If Profitable)
- Start with small position sizes
- Gradually increase if successful
- Maintain strict risk discipline
- Regular performance review

## Strategy Templates

### Basic Template Structure
```python
from AlgorithmImports import *

class StrategyName(QCAlgorithm):
    
    def Initialize(self):
        # Set date range and capital
        self.SetStartDate(2020, 1, 1)
        self.SetEndDate(2024, 12, 31)
        self.SetCash(1000)
        
        # Add securities
        self.symbol = self.AddEquity("STOCK", Resolution.Daily).Symbol
        
        # Set benchmark
        self.SetBenchmark(self.symbol)
        
        # Initialize indicators
        self.indicator = self.SMA(self.symbol, 20)
        
        # Risk management parameters
        self.stop_loss = 0.05
        self.take_profit = 0.10
        
    def OnData(self, slice):
        # Main trading logic
        if self.IsWarmingUp:
            return
            
        # Check data availability
        if self.symbol not in slice:
            return
            
        # Get current price
        current_price = slice[self.symbol].Price
        
        # Implement trading logic here
        pass
        
    def OnEndOfAlgorithm(self):
        # Log final results
        final_value = self.Portfolio.TotalPortfolioValue
        self.Log(f"Final Portfolio Value: ${final_value}")
```

**Final Warning:** Trading involves substantial risk of loss. Only trade with capital you can afford to lose completely. The strategies in this repository are for educational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

**Recommended Approach:** Start with paper trading, use only stable stocks initially, and prioritize capital preservation over returns. Your long-term financial wellbeing is more important than short-term trading profits.
