- **Secondary Goal**: Maintain favorable risk-reward ratio (1.67:1)
- **Target Win Rate**: 60-70%
- **Risk per Trade**: Maximum 2% of portfolio

## 🔧 Algorithm Features

### Multi-Condition Entry System
- Requires **6+ conditions** to be met before entering trades
- Combines trend, momentum, and mean reversion signals
- Uses market regime detection to avoid unfavorable conditions

### Technical Indicators Used
- **EMA 12/26/50**: Trend direction and strength

- **Maximum Position**: 95% of portfolio
- **Minimum Hold Time**: 30 minutes to avoid whipsaws

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- QuantConnect account (free at quantconnect.com)
- Basic understanding of algorithmic trading
- Familiarity with Python (optional but helpful)

### Installation Steps

1. **Login to QuantConnect**
   - Go to [quantconnect.com](https://quantconnect.com)
   - Create account or login

2. **Create New Algorithm**
   - Click "Algorithm Lab"
   - Click "New Algorithm"
   - Choose "Python" language

3. **Copy the Code**
   - Replace default code with the SPY algorithm
   - Save the algorithm

4. **Run Backtest**
   - Click "Backtest" button
   - Wait for results (usually 1-3 minutes)

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Basic Settings (in `Initialize()` method)

```python
# Backtest Period
self.SetStartDate(2020, 1, 1)    # Start date
self.SetEndDate(2024, 12, 31)    # End date

# Capital
self.SetCash(100000)             # Starting capital

# Risk Management
self.stop_loss_pct = 0.015       # 1.5% stop loss
self.take_profit_pct = 0.025     # 2.5% take profit
self.max_position_size = 0.95    # 95% max position
```

### Advanced Settings

```python
# Entry Requirements
min_conditions = 6               # Minimum conditions for entry

# Time Management
self.min_hold_minutes = 30       # Minimum hold time

# Market Hours
# Avoids first 30 minutes and last 15 minutes of trading
```

## 📊 Strategy Logic

### Long Entry Conditions
1. **Trend Alignment**: EMA Fast > EMA Slow, Price > EMA Trend
2. **Market Regime**: Bullish or Neutral environment
3. **Momentum**: RSI between 45-70, MACD bullish
4. **Mean Reversion**: Price near Bollinger Band middle
5. **Volume**: Above-average volume confirmation
6. **Volatility**: Reasonable ATR levels

### Short Entry Conditions
1. **Trend Alignment**: EMA Fast < EMA Slow, Price < EMA Trend
2. **Market Regime**: Bearish or Neutral environment
3. **Momentum**: RSI between 30-55, MACD bearish
4. **Mean Reversion**: Price near Bollinger Band middle
5. **Volume**: Above-average volume confirmation
6. **Volatility**: Reasonable ATR levels

### Exit Conditions
- **Take Profit**: +2.5% gain
- **Stop Loss**: -1.5% loss
- **Trend Reversal**: EMA crossover against position
- **RSI Extremes**: >75 for longs, <25 for shorts
- **End of Day**: 15:45 ET to avoid overnight risk

## 📈 Expected Performance

### Typical Metrics
- **Win Rate**: 60-70%
- **Average Win**: 2.0-2.5%
- **Average Loss**: 1.0-1.5%
- **Maximum Drawdown**: 8-12%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 1.2-1.8
- **Trades per Month**: 15-25

### Performance Characteristics

- **Time decay protection** through position management

## 🛠️ Customization Guide

### Adjusting Risk Tolerance

```python
# Conservative Settings
self.stop_loss_pct = 0.01        # 1% stop loss
self.take_profit_pct = 0.02      # 2% take profit

# Aggressive Settings
self.stop_loss_pct = 0.02        # 2% stop loss
self.take_profit_pct = 0.035     # 3.5% take profit
```

### Changing Entry Sensitivity

```python
# More Selective (Higher Win Rate)
min_conditions_required = 7      # Require more conditions

# More Aggressive (More Trades)
min_conditions_required = 5      # Require fewer conditions
```

### Timeframe Adjustments

```python
# Faster Trading
Resolution.Minute               # Current setting

# Slower Trading
Resolution.Hour                 # Hourly bars
```
