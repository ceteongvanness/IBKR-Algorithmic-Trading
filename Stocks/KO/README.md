# High Win Rate KO (Coca-Cola) Stock Trading Algorithm

## 🥤 Overview

This QuantConnect algorithm implements a high win rate trading strategy specifically designed for KO (The Coca-Cola Company), a blue-chip dividend aristocrat. The strategy is tailored for the unique characteristics of consumer staples stocks: lower volatility, steady dividend payments, and defensive market behavior.

## 🎯 Strategy Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: Achieve 60-75% win rate through conservative approach
- **Secondary Goal**: Capitalize on KO's stable price patterns and dividend schedule
- **Risk Management**: Enhanced protection for dividend stock characteristics
- **Target Trades**: 8-15 per month with longer hold periods

## 🏢 Why KO-Specific Strategy?

### Coca-Cola Characteristics
- **Dividend Aristocrat**: 60+ years of consecutive dividend increases
- **Low Volatility**: Typically 15-25% annual volatility vs 20-30% for SPY
- **Defensive Nature**: Outperforms during market downturns
- **Predictable Patterns**: Strong seasonal and quarterly patterns
- **High Liquidity**: Large market cap with tight spreads

### Algorithm Adaptations for KO
- **Wider Stop Losses**: 2.5% vs 1.5% for higher volatility stocks
- **Higher Profit Targets**: 4% vs 2.5% to account for lower volatility
- **Longer Hold Periods**: 60-minute minimum vs 30-minute for other stocks
- **Dividend Awareness**: Avoids short positions near ex-dividend dates
- **Conservative Sizing**: 1.5% risk per trade vs 2% for growth stocks

## 🛡️ Risk Management

### Dividend-Specific Protections

#### Ex-Dividend Risk Management
```python
# Automatic short position closure before ex-dividend
def IsNearExDividend(self):
    # KO typical ex-dividend periods
    ex_div_periods = [
        (3, 10, 20),   # March
        (6, 10, 20),   # June  
        (9, 10, 20),   # September
        (12, 10, 20)   # December
    ]
    # Returns True if within 5 days of ex-dividend
```

#### Position Sizing for Dividend Stocks
```python
# Conservative approach for stable dividend payer
portfolio_risk = 0.015  # 1.5% risk per trade (vs 2% for growth)
max_position_size = 0.95  # Can go higher due to lower volatility
short_position_limit = 0.30  # Limited short exposure
```

- **Dividend Declarations**: Monthly monitoring
- **Sector Events**: Consumer staples conference avoidance

#### Seasonal Adjustments
- **Holiday Periods**: Reduced position sizing
