# High Win Rate AAPL Options Trading Algorithm

## üìà Overview

This QuantConnect algorithm implements sophisticated options trading strategies for AAPL (Apple Inc.) designed to maximize win rates through premium collection and volatility strategies. The algorithm adapts to different market conditions and volatility regimes to optimize trade selection.

## üéØ Strategy Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: Achieve high win rate (65-75%) through premium collection
- **Secondary Goal**: Generate consistent income from time decay
- **Risk Management**: Limit maximum loss per trade
- **Adaptability**: Adjust strategy based on market regime and volatility

## üîß Algorithm Features

### Multi-Strategy Approach

#### 1. Cash-Secured Puts (Bullish Markets)
- **When**: Bullish market regime + normal/high volatility
- **Strategy**: Sell out-of-the-money puts (~30 delta)
- **Win Rate**: 70-80%
- **Risk**: Must have cash to cover assignment

#### 2. Covered Calls (Bearish/Neutral Markets)
- **When**: Own AAPL stock + bearish/neutral market
- **Strategy**: Sell out-of-the-money calls (~30 delta)
- **Win Rate**: 65-75%
- **Risk**: Stock called away if price rises above strike

#### 3. Short Strangles (High Volatility + Neutral)
- **When**: High volatility + neutral market regime
- **Strategy**: Sell both calls and puts equidistant from current price
- **Win Rate**: 60-70%
- **Risk**: Unlimited risk if price moves significantly

#### 4. Long Options (Low Volatility)
- **When**: Low volatility environment
- **Strategy**: Buy at-the-money calls/puts expecting volatility expansion
- **Win Rate**: 40-50% (but higher profit potential)

### Technical Analysis System

#### Market Regime Detection
- **EMA 20/50**: Trend identification
- **RSI (14)**: Momentum analysis
- **Price vs EMAs**: Bullish/bearish/neutral classification

#### Volatility Regime Analysis
- **Bollinger Bands**: Volatility expansion/contraction
- **ATR (14)**: Average true range for volatility measurement
- **Rolling Volatility**: 30-day price change volatility

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Customization

### Adjusting Win Rate vs Profit Potential

```python
# Higher Win Rate (Lower Profit)
self.target_delta = 0.20         # Further out-of-the-money
self.profit_target = 0.30        # Take profit earlier

# Higher Profit Potential (Lower Win Rate)
self.target_delta = 0.40         # Closer to the money
self.profit_target = 0.70        # Hold longer for more profit
```

### Volatility Strategy Adjustment

```python
# More Conservative (Sell Premium)
high_vol_threshold = 0.06        # Lower threshold for high vol

# More Aggressive (Buy Options)
low_vol_threshold = 0.05         # Higher threshold for low vol
```

### Position Sizing Modifications

```python
# Conservative Sizing
max_capital_per_trade = 0.20     # Maximum 20% per trade
max_positions = 2                # Fewer simultaneous positions

# Aggressive Sizing
max_capital_per_trade = 0.40     # Maximum 40% per trade
max_positions = 5                # More simultaneous positions
